# Technical Challenge – Automated Extraction of Disease Descriptions and ICD Coding from Clinical PDFs

This challenge focuses on designing and implementing an automated workflow that can process clinical or
disease-related PDF documents and convert extracted disease descriptions into standardized ICD codes.

The input consists of a large number of PDF documents. Several documents contain digital text, while others include
scanned or handwritten content that requires OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The system must operate
reliably across this diversity of document formats and quality.

## Objectives

1. **Identify disease-related descriptions** within the provided PDF documents.
2. **Map the extracted descriptions to standardized ICD codes** (e.g., ICD-10-CM).

## Questions to Address

1. **Workflow Design**  
   How would you design an automated end-to-end workflow that accomplishes text extraction, disease
   identification, and ICD mapping at scale?

2. **Essential Components**  
   What major modules, functions, and processing stages are required for your workflow?

3. **Challenges & Considerations**  
   What technical and operational challenges must be accounted for when building such a system, especially when
   handling scanned PDFs, resource constraints, large-scale workloads, or clinical terminology?

4. **Performance Evaluation**  
   What key performance metrics would you use to evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of your
   workflow?

## Expectations

- You may use external resources, tools, libraries, and public documentation.  
- If AI assistance is used, document the model(s) and justify how you accepted, modified, or rejected the outputs.  
- Do not include any confidential or proprietary information in your submission.  
- The final answer should reflect your own system design and engineering judgment.
